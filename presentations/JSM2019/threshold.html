# Estimation of Student Attendance Threshold for K-12 Education

## Background

- A project collaborated with Nebraska Department of Education (NDE)

- Overarching goal
  &gt; *To identify the threshold for the number of absent days after which the impact on student outcomes necessitates prevention or intervention in Nebraska public schools.*

- By current Nebraska attendance laws, schools are required to refer all students absent more than 20 days (whether the absences were excused or not) to their local county attorney.

- There were parents calling to change the attendance policy. (http://netnebraska.org/article/news/attendance-policy-revisions-left-school-boards)

---

## Data

- Before cleaning
    - 10 years data: 07/08 - 16/17
    - Student level (days absent, days present, grade, gender, race, immigrant, homeless, state test scores, etc.)
    - School level (number of students, etc.)
    - School district level (annual number of school days, etc.)

- After cleaning and business rules
    - 7 years data: 10/11 - 16/17
    - Math and reading scores for grades 3,4,5,6,7,8,11
    - Percent absent replaces days absent and days present
    - Entries by student and year

## Mixed effects analysis

`$$\texttt{y}=\texttt{X} \beta +\texttt{Z}u+\varepsilon$$`

- Response
    - Test score
- Fixed effects
    - percent absent, course, school count, grade level, gender, race, percent school days, homeless, highly mobile, immigrant, school membership, year
- Random effects
    - student
    - school and school district (not used)

#### Variable selection

- Nonlinear forms for percent absent
- Interaction terms

---

## Threshold estimation

- The limitation of linear mixed model is that it doesn't help to estimate the percent absent threshold.
- Not much work is done for threshold estimation with education data (Paredes &amp; Ugarte, 2011). 
- Similar research mainly focuses survival and financial data, which has different definition of "threshold".
- Related methods include threshold regression (Dagenais, 1969; Lee &amp; Whitmore, 2006) and panel threshold regression (Hansen, 1999).

---

## Panel threshold regression (PTR)

- Model

`$$y_{it}=\alpha_i+\beta_1'x_{it}\mathbb{I}_{(q_{it}\leq c)}+\beta_2'x_{it}\mathbb{I}_{(q_{it}&gt;c)}+\varepsilon_{it}$$`
- Where
    - `\(i\)` for individual and `\(t\)` for time
    - `\(\alpha_i\)` is a fixed effect
    - `\(q\)` is a threshold variable and `\(q_{it}\)` is scalar
    - `\(c\)` is a threshold parameter
    - `\(x_{it}\)` is a `\(k\)`-vector regressor

--

- Estimation
`$$\hat{c}=\underset{c\in\Theta}{\arg\min}SSR(c)$$`

---

## Result by PTR

#### Is it too early for schools to report to county attorney?

---

## A different approach

- PTR model is modified for attendance problem to measure the average score difference between two groups whose percent absent is split by the threshold.

`$$y=\alpha\mathbb{I}_{(q\leq c)}+\textit{X}\beta +\textit{Z}u +\varepsilon$$`

- Where
    - `\(q\)` is percent absent and `\(c\)` is the threshold parameter.
    - `\(\textit{X}\)` include other fixed effects.
    - `\(\textit{Z}\)` are random effects.

---

## A close look at `\(\alpha\)`

- `\(\alpha\)` is the average score difference between two groups split by threshold `\(c\)`.
    - `\(\alpha\)` is expected to be positive, as previous studies in education field showed that more absence resulted in worse test score.
    - For `\(c\)` in a reasonable range (say, 1% - 25%), `\(\alpha\)` is non-decreasing.

--

### `\(\alpha\)` and the goal

- A good time for early intervention is the time that `\(\alpha\)` starts to increase at a fast speed.
- The threshold for the highest impact on student academic outcomes (real action is needed, e.g. report to attorney) should be the time when the acceleration rate of `\(\alpha\)` reaches the peak.

---

## Estimation of `c`

- There can be a functional relationship between `\(\alpha\)` and `\(c\)`
    - `\(\alpha = f(c)\)` for `\(c\in (c_1,c_2)\)`, where `\(f\)` is a non-decreasing function.
    - Note: `\(f\)` is a step function as percent absent is not strictly continous.

--

- Assume `\(\alpha = f(c)+\epsilon\)` where `\(f\)` is a non-decreasing differentiable function.
- The threshold estimation `\(\hat{c}\)` is the point of inflection, i.e., `\(f'\)` has a maximum at `\(\hat{c}\)`.
- An early warning can be given at the inflection point of `\(f'\)` assuming `\(f\)` is twice differentiable.

---

## Result: `alpha` vs. `c`

## Summary

- Proposing a new algorithm to estimate the threshold of absence days after which the impact on student outcomes necessitates prevention or intervention in Nebraska public schools.
- Focusing on the coefficient that estimated the average score difference between two groups.
- Using the inflection point to estimate the threshold.
- Suggesting two thresholds: one for early intervention and one for the highest impact on student outcomes.
- Result for early intervention threshold coincides with panel threshold regression.
- Comparing the absenteeism impact between courses and population groups.
